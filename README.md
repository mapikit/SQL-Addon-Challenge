## Introduction
**If you (or someone you know) are an SQL magician, this challenge is for you to test your knowledge!** üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

For those who don't already know, Meta-System can have Addons to add new functionality to the engine since v0.4 (Andromeda).

In Meta-System, you define the system entities at the `"schemas"` array, but they alone won't do much, as they're just data types.

With Addons, however, it is possible to add functionality to those schemas, including saving them to databases, fetching and deleting them too!

This added functionality is called "Schema Functions", and they can have any interface and name you want. For instance, there could be a  "save" function to update or insert the entity into the database, or they could be separated into their own functions.

**Now here's the challenge**: Which functions would you add to Schemas, and what would be their resulting SQL Queries? And how would you create the tables to fit the given schemas and manage their relationships? **How do you handle a system with unkown data types?**

## The Challenge

You'll be creating an Addon to be simply the best for working with Meta-System's Schemas in PostgreSQL. You can do saving, fetching, paginating, migrating, grouping, and whatever else you think will be the killer feature for your Addon!

Of course, you'll also need to work around the limitations and requirements of the challenge. If you do good, we'll be sure to eternize your magician skills by giving you permanently your profile/Socials and Addon featured on the new upcoming homepage of Meta-System!

There will also be a prize pool, which the value will be shared soon!

## Goals

Magician competition aside, this challenge aims to foster community interaction around Open-Source solutions, while providing a fun challenge to solve. At the end, the community benefits from having a battle tested Library/Addon to rely on to build their applications!

Additionally, this process will help the Contributors of Meta-System to be aware of currently unknown improvement aspects of the Engine and the API, which will aid on setting future development goals.
